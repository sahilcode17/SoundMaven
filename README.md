# SoundMaven
An Audio Tagging System Based on Kaggle Challenge [Freesound Audio Tagging](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging-2019)

### Working 
The task consists of predicting the audio labels (tags) for every test clip.
Some test clips bear one label while others bear several labels. 
The predictions are to be done at the clip level, i.e., no start/end timestamps for the sound events are required.
